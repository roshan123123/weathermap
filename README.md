# weathermap

This is a very basic project to understand how apis work.
I have used openweathermap api to fetch the temperature from this api.

The user has to input a city name if the data for that city is avilable api will give the data and it will be displayed in the frontend
but if the data is not avilable it will redirect you to a page which says no data avialable.
